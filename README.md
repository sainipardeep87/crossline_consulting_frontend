# Immigration Work Portal (React + Vite + Bootstrap)

A clean, Bootstrap-styled React starter for immigration workflows: manage clients, cases, tasks, appointments, documents, and more.

## Quick start
```bash
# 1) Unzip and cd into folder
npm install
npm run dev
# app runs on http://localhost:5173
```

## Tech
- React 18 + Vite
- React Router v6
- Bootstrap 5 (CDN + npm dep for future custom builds)

## Pages
- Dashboard
- Clients
- Cases
- Tasks
- Appointments
- Documents
- Settings

## Notes
- Uses a simple, modern admin layout (top navbar + sidebar + content).
- Replace demo data in `src/pages/*` with real API calls later.
